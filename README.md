# Aria Helper

A simple redux app built on [redux-coffee-boilerplate](https://github.com/xouabita/redux-coffee-boilerplate) written in coffeescript 

After struggling to figure out the functions and requirements of aria attributes on [w3](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/), I decided to make an easily consumable app to organize them in a way my brain understands.

#TODO

There's still a lot that needs to be done here. At the very least:
- Make this app accessible!!
- Styling
- Richer information on each attribute
